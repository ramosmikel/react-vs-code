# Choices I made ðŸ¤ž

<br/>

<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
    ðŸ‘‰ <u>Redux vs Context</u> 
    </div>
    
      This project contains complex & high frequency updates on the state, optimizing Context will be significantly more complex than Redux. Context triggers re-renders on every update.
    
    
      Every selector was cached using a connector, to try reduce the amount of re-renders.
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    ðŸ‘‰ <u>Project Structure & Logic</u> 
    </div>
    
      This project contains one page, therefore I decided to try keep all the logic within the index page.
    
    
      Custom hooks were created for dispatching redux actions.
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    ðŸ‘‰ <u>Todo's</u> 
    </div>
    
      Purifying and perfomance testing components.
    
    
      Writing Unit, Integration & End-to-end tests.
    
    
      Refactor & optimize CSS.
    
     
      Alert & Confirmation dialogs.
    
  </li>
</ul>
